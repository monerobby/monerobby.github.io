I started by building the vertical stabilizer. This is supposedly the most simple assembly of the kit.

After taking inventory of the kit, and laying out parts in a room inside, I continued to build a workshop in my garage, and order tools I would need. Many of the tools I would need, I purchased from a kit from [Planetools.com](https://planetools.com/).

I ordered a couple of practice projects with the kit. They gave me an opportunity to make mistakes and learn how to use my new tools and construction methods.

Also I took a trip to Airventure to see some flying examples of what I was building and learn as much as I could.
