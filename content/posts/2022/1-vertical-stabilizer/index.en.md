I started by building the vertical stabilizer. This is supposedly the most simple assembly of the kit.

After flattening the spar reinforcement which comes in the kit with a curve from the coil of material it is manufactured from, I assembled the skeleton.

Next, the skin was also cleco-clamped into place.

All holes were then "match-drilled" to final size, as the parts arrive from the factory slightly undersized. Then the assembly was disassembled and I began final preparation of each part. The edges and holes of each part need to be deburred to a smooth finish to prevent cracking. This is a time consuming and tedious process. 

Certain holes are also dimpled or countersunk so that rivets can sit flush in the material.

Next, the surfaces of each part are scuffed, cleaned, and primed to help prevent corrosion. This is optional for aluminum clad parts (which are the majority). It adds a lot of time and effort, but I've decided to prime all parts to start. I am using a product called "SEM self-etching primer".

With all of the parts prepared, it is time to assemble and rivet.

Finally, the skin is riveted on top of the skeleton.

Now just the root ribs and rear spar need to be riveted in place. I will do this once the assembly has been inspected by an experienced EAA tech counselor.
