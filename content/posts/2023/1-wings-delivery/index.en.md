I ordered the wings in October 2022 and expected a 1 year lead time. However once again, the kit was ready much earlier than expected and it was delivered January 27, 2023. A few of the parts were backordered and I would received them at a later date.

The truck from ABF shipping arrived with two men and a forklift and placed the crates inside the garage.
