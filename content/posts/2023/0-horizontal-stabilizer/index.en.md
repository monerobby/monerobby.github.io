The second assembly I completed was the horizontal stabilizer. This follows a similar process as the vertical stabilizer, except it is larger, there are two skins, and the front spar requires some trimming and bending.

I made my first major mistake when working on one of the front spars. After trimming the flange, bending, and creating the relief notch, I was sanding the edges and accidentally knocked the surface of the part into the belt sander leaving a large gash. This is an important structural part, and I would need to order a [replacement spar](https://store.vansaircraft.com/hs-702-front-spar-hs-702.html) from Vans.

Eventually I recieved the replacement part and was able to continue. After preparing and priming the parts, I began riveting the skeleton.

At the begining of 2023, Vans released a service bulletin for the RV-7 outboard elevator hinges due to possible cracking in this area. New parts were designed and sent out to me including a nested spar doubler. Luckily, because of my slow building speed, I did not need to remove any rivets to install the new parts:

Next, I riveted the front spars together with spar doublers and reinforcement angles. The cleco clamps with masking tape were to remind me to not rivet these holes. This is where the horizontal stabilizer will eventually attach to the fuselage.

The two rivets joining the the inboard forward ribs were particular tricky. Unfortunately I didn't properly set the rivets on the left side and need to remove them. Furthermore, when I removed them, I realized the holes were now slightly oversized. After consulting with Vans support, their recommendation was to use Cherrymax oversize universal head rivets in place of the solid rivets. I picked these up from [Aircraft Spruce](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/hapages/cherrymax4.php?clickkey=295853). I cleaned up the holes to the proper diameter for the Cherrymax oversize rivets and was able to set them without further issue.

Finally, it is time to rivet the skins onto the horizontal stabilizer structure.

Next the nose rib was blind riveted to the rest of the completed structure.

The skin was clamped into place and I proceed to rivet the rest of the skin to the structure.

The rest of the skin was also riveted.

The only thing that remains is to squeeze rivets on the inboard and outboard ribs, and on the rear spar, which I will do at a later date after my work is inspected by an EAA tech counselor. Once the rear spar is riveted, it becomes difficult to inspect indside the structure.
