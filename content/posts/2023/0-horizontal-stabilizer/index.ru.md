Вторую сборку, которую я закончил, был горизонтальный стабилизатор. Этот процесс похож на того дла вертикалного стабилизатор кроме он больше, есть две обшивки, и передняя балка требует некоторой обрезки и изгиба.

{{< figure src="IMG_1777.jpeg" caption="Первоначальная сборка задней балки. Здесь уже видно, что центральная шарнирная скоба и подшипник уже заклеплены, и они в конечном итоге будут присоединены к рулевым поверхностям.">}}

 Я сделал первуюб серьёзную ошибку когда работал над одной из передних балок.  After trimming the flange, bending, and creating the relief holes, I was sanding the edges and accidentally knocked the surface of the part into the belt sander leaving a large gash. This is an important structural part, and I would need to order a replacement spar from Vans ($22 + shipping).

Eventually I recieved the replacement part and was able to continue. After finishing preperation and priming of the parts, I began riveting the skeleton.

At the begining of 2023, Vans released a service bulletin for the RV-7 outboard elevator hinges due to possible cracking in this area. New parts were designed and sent out to me including a nested spar doubler. Luckily because of my slow building speed, I did not need to remove any rivets to install the new parts:

Next, I riveted the front spars together with spar doublers and reinforcement angles. The cleco clamps with masking tape were to remind me to not rivet these holes. This is where the horizontal stabilizer will eventually attach to the fuselage.

The two rivets joining the the inboard forward ribs were particular tricky. Unfortunately I didn't properly set the rivets on the left side and need to remove them. Furthermore, when I removed them, I realized the holes were now slightly oversized. After consulting with Vans support, their recommendation was to use Cherrymax oversize universal head rivets in place of the solid rivets. I picked these up from Aircraft Spruce. I cleaned up the holes to the proper diameter for the Cherrymax oversize rivets and was able to set them without further issue.

Finally, it is time to rivet the skins onto the horizontal stabilizer structure.

Next the nose rib was blind riveted to the rest of the completed structure.

The skin was clamped into place and I proceed to rivet the rest of the skin to the structure.

The skin was also riveted on the bottom side, and the right skin was riveted too.

The only thing that remains is to squeeze rivets on the inboard and outboard ribs, and on the rear spar, which I will do at a later date after my work is inspected by an EAA tech counselor. Once the rear spar is riveted, it becomes difficult to inspect indside the structure.
