I've started building a [Vans RV-7A](https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-7/) homebuilt aircraft. I ordered the empennage kit in May 2022. The factory estimated delivery in approximately 11 months. A long time to wait, but I still needed to setup a workshop, buy lots of tools, and learn the process of aircraft building. However, the kit arrived at the end of June, after just 2 months.

After taking inventory of the kit, I continued to build a workshop in my garage.

I ordered a couple of practice projects with the kit. They gave me an opportunity to make mistakes and learn how to use my new tools and construction methods.

Also I took a trip to Airventure to see some flying examples of what I was building and learn as much as I could.
