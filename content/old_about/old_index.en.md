My name is Robby Weinberg. I started building a Vans RV-7A kit in 2022. I will use this website to document the build.

### Background
I graduated from Cal Poly SLO with a degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2014. I have since been working professionally as a software developer. I live in Phoenix, Arizona.
